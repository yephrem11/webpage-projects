        <h1>Othello Game</h1>
        <p>Othello is a strategy game between 2 people where they fight for space on the board. You take turns placing a disc on the board. The goal is to "sandwich" your opponents discs and when you do this their discs become yours. Whoever has the most discs with all spaces filled wins. You can only make a move if there is a play on the board where you can "sandwich" at least one of the other teams discs. If you cannot make a move your turn gets skipped. I was taught this game over christmas break and I've been enjoying playing it (shoutout to my uncle Matt for showing me the game). Click the image below to play. Have fun and enjoy!</p>
